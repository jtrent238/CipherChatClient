Cipher Chat Client
================

Cipher Chat is chat room software that uses AES-CBC 128 bit and RSA 4096 bit encryption that allows users with the client software connect to a computer that is running the server software. There is no central third party server that routes connections since the connections are based on connecting directly to an IP address. This allows complete control over the privacy of the conversations.
